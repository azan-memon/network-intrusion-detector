# network-intrusion-detector
This is a multi-classification Machine Learning model to identify type of attack on network dataset. 

### Network Intrusion Detection with Machine Learning

This project conducts data cleaning, exploratory data analysis and machine learning techniques; SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression and KNN, to classify multiple types of network intrusions. 

### Data Source

The dataset was originally used in KDD competition in 1999. For the purpose of this project we are using a stratified sample of about 500,000 records.

### Contributing Guidelines

This project was built in ML-575 course at University of Illinois Chicago by Azan Memon in collaboration with Anandita Jain, Siddharth Agrawal and Samridhi Madan
